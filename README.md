# Variable Cycler
A Stream Elements Widget that cycles your latest followers, subscribers, donations or cheers.

## Usage
Once this widget is approved by StreamElements you will be able to add it to your overlay.
For now you can create a custom widget in your StreamElements overlay and paste the content of the four files in the corresponding field in the custom widget (Fields = JSON).
After that you can configure the settings of the overlay in the panel on the right side of the overlay editor.
You can customize a lot of things.

## Disclaimer
This widget uses the Twitch API, which uses a CLIENT_ID. For now I've supplied my own CLIENT_ID, but I can't guarantee I will keep that CLIENT_ID alive.
If you don't want to rely on my CLIENT_ID go get yourself one [here](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps)
